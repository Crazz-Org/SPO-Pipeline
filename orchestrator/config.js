// Split by where the step's authority lives, not by which model runs it:
//   - orchestration-side steps (DIAGNOSE, VALIDATE, CITATION_VERIFIER) judge artifacts the
//     orchestrator already produced -- diff, gate log, ledger, PR -- and run from this repo's
//     own root.
//   - worktree-side steps (PLAN, IMPLEMENT) read and write the product itself, so they run
//     from inside the task's own product worktree.
//
// WHY this is a policy and not "always the worktree": a live measurement (2026-08, this
// machine) of a `claude -p` call issued from the product worktree showed ~40k input tokens of
// preamble (root + directory-scoped CLAUDE.md files, doc auto-discovery) before the model does
// any work; the same call issued from a lean directory with no such tree was far smaller.
// Multiplied across every PLAN/IMPLEMENT/DIAGNOSE/VALIDATE call in a task, that is real,
// avoidable spend -- so DIAGNOSE/VALIDATE deliberately do NOT run inside the product worktree,
// even though nothing stops their read-only tools from reaching into it.
